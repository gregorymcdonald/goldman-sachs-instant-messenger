# Goldman Sachs Instant Messenger (GSIM)
This project is intended as an exercise to ready myself for work on the ION team at Goldman Sachs.
The prompt for this project is
> Create a WebSocket-based AIM chat messenger client using React for the front-end and a Vert.x Java back-end.
> Upload the project into a GitHub repository [the one your currently viewing] and send it to Adam Fleming for code review.
